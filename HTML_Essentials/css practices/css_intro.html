<h4>“Nice to meet you, Doctor. I’m Lyra, a perfumer. Interesting job, right? Did you know it existed?”</h4>

<h4>Though her elegance and grace make her aromatherapy career seem effortless, Perfumer is a hard worker who built her business from the ground up. Her perfectionist work ethic shines through on the battlefield, where she tends to her allies’ wounds with soothing blends of lavender essence. As the easiest AOE Medic to obtain and one of Arknight's few sources of global healing, Perfumer is a staple Operator for many players, both old and new.</h4>
